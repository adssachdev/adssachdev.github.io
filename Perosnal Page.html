  <h1><u>Aman Sachdev's Personal Page</u></h1>
	<p style="border:2px solid black">
		I am a senior at the Rutgers Business School studying Supply Chain Management and Business Analytics and Information Technology.
		Working more in the supply chain field next year, I took a position with Lockheed Martin in their 3 year operational leadership rotational programs.
		I took supply chain because I found it fun and interesting to work on new projects and help develop a system to suport all other workers in a company.
		However, I also choose to do something more related to technology and coding due to my interest in it as well as for my own knowledge. It is a great skill to know coding or at least understand it.
		I am a hardworking and dedicated student who loves to learn and try out new things. 
		If you would like to contact me, feel free to reach out to me at my email: <u>ads261@scareletmail.rugters.edu</u>.
		Thank you for looking at my page!
